# VCADS-Bayesian-Neural-Networks
Engineering systems have been traditionally modeled to be linear. However, increasing demands for precision and the fact that many phenomena cannot even be predicted qualitatively by linear methods has made nonlinear analysis techniques more and more important. We have focused on mechanical systems.

## Synthetic Data BNN Model Build / Load
This code is a culmination of work done to investigate Bayesian Neural Networks 
as a means of capturing the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty inherent and
present within a model. With BNNs, one is able to gather from the model where
and how uncertain the model is to better ones understanding of the data. The data used for 
modeling is synthetically created using a differential equation solver.

## Experimental Data BNN Model Build / Load
This code is a culmination of work done to investigate Bayesian Neural Networks 
as a means of capturing the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty inherent and
present within a model. With BNNs, one is able to gather from the model where
and how uncertain the model is to better ones understanding of the data. This code
is used to extract raw experimental data from files collected on 12/17/2022 for training.
